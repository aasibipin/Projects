# Welcome to this repository.

This is a compilation of the projects I have completed.

# Table of Contents: 

1. Speech Analysis & Classification
 A matlab implementation of analysing speech formants and automatically distingusing between female and male voices. 

2. 3D Computer Vision Displacement Tracker
A Biomedical Engineering Capstone component where I used one camera to measure 3D displacement of a target within 4mm accuracy on a Raspberry Pi in Python. Algorithm detects targets and preprocess video in OpenCV.  Note: The Server IMU Folder can be ignored. 

3. TensorFlow tutorials
A series of indepth tutorials implementing labs from IBM's Cognitive AI Classes in TensorFlow. Trained and tested a variety of Deep Learning Models in classification and regression problems.
