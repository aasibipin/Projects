1. Computer Vision - 3D Displacement Tracker
A Biomedical Engineering Capstone component where I used one camera to measure 3D displacement of a target within 4mm accuracy on a Raspberry Pi in Python. Algorithm detects targets and preprocess video in OpenCV.  Note: The Server IMU Folder can be ignored. 

2. Speech Analysis & Classification
 A matlab implementation of analysing speech formants and automatically distingusing between female and male voices. 

3. TensorFlow tutorials
A series of indepth tutorials implementing labs from IBM's Cognitive AI Classes in TensorFlow. Trained and tested a variety of Deep Learning Models in classification and regression problems on MNIST and Movie Reccomendation Datasets.
